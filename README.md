# We Ride Cycling Club 
<image src="assets/readme-files/we-ride-devices-mockup.png" width="600px" text-align="center"></image>

We Ride Cycling Club is a fictional cycling community for expats in Europe. We Ride Cycling Club matches expats with "Local Leaders" in the city they are moving to. The cyclists can join the group rides lead by the Local Leaders, meet fellow expats and get access to a database of cycling routes to upload to their Garmin to explore solo. 

The goal of We Ride Cycling Club website is to help the club build a community network of cyclists across Europe, help expats discover their new home from a local perspective, and provide an easy sign up registration process for cyclists. We Rice Cycling Club wants to make it easy and less daunting for cyclists to discover their new home.

- [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/): was used to check accessibility the score of each site page and to see if there were issues. 
    - This tool highlighted an issue with radio button labels on the Join Us page. The wrong "for" value had been assigned to the 80-100km radio button which impacted the accessbility score. After fixing this issue the accessibility score increased from 90 to 100. Initial Lighthouse report: 
    <br>
    <image src="assets/readme-files/lighthouse-join-us-accessibility.png" width="600px"></image>
- Lighthouse Reports:
    - index.html
    <br>
    <image src="assets/readme-files/lighthouse-report-index.png" width="600px"></image>
    - about.html
    <br>
    <image src="assets/readme-files/lighthouse-report-about.png" width="600px"></image>
    - join-us.html
    <br>
    <image src="assets/readme-files/lighthouse-report-join.png" width="600px"></image>
    - contact.html
    <br>
    <image src="assets/readme-files/lighthouse-report-contact.png" width="600px"></image>
